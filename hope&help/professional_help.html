                    <b>Here are some helpful tips for what to look for in a doctor or therapist.</b>
                </p>
                <ul id="helpful-tips">
                    <li>Look for someone who specializes in bipolar disorder and is up to date with current science. Medications and therapy treatments change quickly with new and better treatment options coming along all the time.</li>
                    <li>Look for someone who takes the time to carefully listen to you and responds with genuine care and respect.  Make sure you are seen, heard, and taken seriously.</li>
                    <li>Look for someone who you are at ease with and comfortable with. Having a good relationship with your doctor or therapist is crucial. If you are uncomfortable or dissatisfied, that is a good enough reason to change.</li>
                    <li>Look for a doctor who only prescribes one medication at a time so that both you and they can easily tell what is effective and what side affects are from what medication.</li>
                    <li>Look for a therapist who is experienced in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). These are currently the most recommended and effective therapies for BP.</li>

                        “The biggest thing I’ve learned is bi-polar doesn’t define me and it doesn’t control my life. 
                        Through counseling, taking Latuda, regulating my sleep, being careful with my caffeine intake,
                        and being mindful of where I’m at emotionally, I can make needed changes accordingly, I’ve 
                        been able to minimize my mood swings and take back control of myself and my life. “ -B.E
