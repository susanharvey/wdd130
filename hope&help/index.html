                    “Ten years ago, I never would have expected to be chasing my dreams and thriving in a challenging, high stress environment. I had to be honest with myself about my illness and listen to my body. I had to make sure to prioritize sleep, food, and be willing to seek out help and a robust support system.”  -S.L.H
