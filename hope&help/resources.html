                    "Reading about others' experiences helped me feel less alone.
                    Educating myself about bipolar helped me not to blame myself.
                    I learned that the brain is an organ that gets sick - just
                    like the heart or stomach or lungs. It helped me understand 
                    and accept the need for medications and learn about other 
                    self-care things I could do to feel better." -B.G
