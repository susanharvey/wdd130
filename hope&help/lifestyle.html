                    "By doing the little things to improve my life, it is easier. Having compassion on myself and improving the way that I cope and care for myself and my emotions has made all the difference. Adjusting the words and tone that I use when I talk to/think about myself and my feelings has helped reduce anxiety and shaming and increased my ability to thrive and enjoy life once more.â€œ  -D.J
