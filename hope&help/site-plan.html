      </p>
      <p>
      “Ten years ago, I never would have expected to be chasing my dreams and thriving in a challenging, high stress environment. I had to be honest with myself about my illness and listen to my body. I had to make sure to prioritize sleep, food, and be willing to seek out help and a robust support system.”  -S.L.H

        "Reading about others' experiences helped me feel less alone.
        Educating myself about bipolar helped me not to blame myself.
        I learned that the brain is an organ that gets sick - just
        like the heart or stomach or lungs. It helped me understand 
        and accept the need for medications and learn about other 
        self-care things I could do to feel better." -B.G

      <h3>Lifestyle Helps</h3>
      <p>
        The best way to begin your thriving journey is by making basic lifestyle changes that are good for everyone but especially for those living with BP. 
      </p>
      <p>
        -Eat regularly. Choose healthy foods with a variety of protein, fruits and vegetables, and grains. Lower fat, sugar and salt. Reduce caffeine intake. Avoid alcohol and drugs.<br> 
        -Establish a regular exercise routine, something you enjoy, 30 minutes a day.<br>
        -Establish a consistent sleep routine and schedule and get enough sleep.<br> 
        -Learn to manage stress. Meditation, massage, yoga, deep breathing, tai chi, or listening to calming music are all great tools for managing stress.<br> 
        -Learn to set boundaries. It is okay to say no and not do everything.<br>
        -Take time to do the things you love and enjoy. Avoid extensive TV watching and social media.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Lifestyle changes can make a huge difference in your ability to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        "By doing the little things to improve my life, it is easier. Having compassion on myself and improving the way that I cope and care for myself and my emotions has made all the difference. Adjusting the words and tone that I use when I talk to/think about myself and my feelings has helped reduce anxiety and shaming and increased my ability to thrive and enjoy life once more.“  -D.J

      <h3>Professional Help</h3>
      <p>
        Seeking caring, knowledgeable, and responsive medical treatment and counseling/therapy is important for those with bipolar disorder.<br>Both medication and therapy are important and will help you thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
         Here are some helpful tips for what to look for in a doctor or therapist.<br>
        -Look for someone who specializes in bipolar disorder and is up to date with current science. Medications and therapy treatments change quickly with new and better treatment options coming along all the time.<br>
        -Look for someone who takes the time to carefully listen to you and responds with genuine care and respect.  Make sure you are seen, heard, and taken seriously.<br>
        -Look for someone who you are at ease with and comfortable with. Having a good relationship with your doctor or therapist is crucial. If you are uncomfortable or dissatisfied, that is a good enough reason to change.<br>
        -Look for a doctor who only prescribes one medication at a time so that both you and they can easily tell what is effective and what side affects are from what medication.<br> 
        -Look for a therapist who is experienced in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy {CBT). These are currently the most recommended and effective therapies for BP.

        “The biggest thing I’ve learned is bi-polar doesn’t define me and it doesn’t control my life. Through counseling, taking Latuda, regulating my sleep, being careful with my caffeine intake, and being mindful of where I’m at emotionally, I can make needed changes accordingly, I’ve been able to minimize my mood swings and take back control of myself and my life. “ -B.E
