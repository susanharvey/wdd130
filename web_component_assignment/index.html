        <h2>Life Doesn't Frighten Me</h2>
        <h3>Poem by Maya Angelou</h3>
        <p>
            Shadows on the wall<br>
            Noises down the hall<br>
            Life doesn't frighten me at all<br>

            Bad dogs barking loud<br>
            Big ghosts in a cloud<br>
            Life doesn't frighten me at all<br>

            Mean old Mother Goose<br>
            Lions on the loose<br>
            They don't frighten me at all<br>

            Dragons breathing flame<br>
            On my counterpane<br>
            That doesn't frighten me at all.<br>

            I go boo<br>
            Make them shoo<br>
            I make fun<br>
            Way they run<br>
            I won't cry<br>
            So they fly<br>
            I just smile<br>
            They go wild<br>

            Life doesn't frighten me at all.<br>

            Tough guys fight<br>
            All alone at night<br>
            Life doesn't frighten me at all.<br>

            Panthers in the park<br>
            Strangers in the dark<br>
            No, they don't frighten me at all.<br>

            That new classroom where<br>
            Boys all pull my hair<br>
            (Kissy little girls<br>
            With their hair in curls)<br>
            They don't frighten me at all.<br>

            Don't show me frogs and snakes<br>
            And listen for my scream,<br>
            If I'm afraid at all<br>
            It's only in my dreams.<br>

            I've got a magic charm<br>
            That I keep up my sleeve<br>
            I can walk the ocean floor<br>
            And never have to breathe.<br>

            Life doesn't frighten me at all<br>
            Not at all<br>
            Not at all.<br>

            Life doesn't frighten me at all.<br>
            Life Doesn't Frighten Me<br><br>
            Maya Angelou
