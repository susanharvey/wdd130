                <h3>Highlights From the Past Season</h3>
                <p>
                    What an incredible season we have had!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip.
                </p>    
                <p>    
                    Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

                    Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States.  We share these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself face to face with one. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America.

                <p>
                    It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them detect and avoid predators.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    The bighorn sheep is named for its huge, spiral horns, which in the male can reach lengths of over 3.3 feet and weigh up to 30 pounds. 
                    Females also have horns, but they are shorter with less curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting. Bighorns can deliver
                    a headbutt at 35 mph with enough power to instantly kill a human being. 
                </p>
                <p id="warning">
                    If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel threatened.
